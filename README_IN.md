# Astralia 🔭 - Final Project (DAM) 📋🚀

*[README in Spanish](README.md)*

**Astralis** is an Android application developed as a **Final Project** for the Higher Vocational
Training
Cycle in **Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)**.

Its main goal is to provide an educational and visual experience about celestial bodies in the
universe.  
Users can explore a wide range of data about planets, stars, moons, and more, viewing detailed
information,
images, and categorized content.

This application aims to implement an interface that moves with the device's motion,
allowing it to show the real-time location of celestial bodies in the sky. It also includes a
calendar of astronomical events.
